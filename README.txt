1. Upon starting the program you will be presented with a clean slate. You are tasted with filling it with ART.

2. Draw stuff. This is the most complicated step, as drawing is hard and takes years of training. 
	Unfortunately, this app is awful for trainig, because it sucks. Drawing with this application
	can only be done by a true master. 

	Left clicking will put points on the screen, indicated by your rad little pointer. 
	Right clicking will give you a dope menu with a bunch of dropdowns. 
	Space will finalize any kind of crazy polygon or line strip you make. 

	You've got a few options when drawing things. You can just put triangles on the screen,
	or you could go nuts with some other cool shape options such as :
		Points (bland)
		Lines (mild)
		Quads (spicy)
		Polygons (particularly spicy)
	You can choose which one you want in the Shapes dropdown with a right click. 

	Furthermore, you can turn these shapes and drawings all SORTS of wild colors such as:
		Literially just the rainbow. 
		 (red) (orange) (yellow) (green) (blue) (purple)
	And on top of that, every point you place can have its own COLOR. Allowing you to make some 
		DOPE GRADIANTS!
	If you're like me, and hate going through the drop menu to change your dang color, you can use 
	the following keys:
		1: red 
		2: orange 
		3: yellow 
		4: green 
		5: blue 
		6: purple

	On a lesser note, you can vary the size of lines and points with those other options on the dropdown
		or whatever. Your call, dude. 

3. Publush your work to the world. You've done it. You're a champion. I'm proud of you.
